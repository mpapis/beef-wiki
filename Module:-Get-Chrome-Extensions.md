_TODO_

## Feedback

* Apparently it has been blocked recently by Chrome : it is not working on my Chrome 22 with error : _Denying load of chrome-extension://bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp/manifest.json. Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension._
