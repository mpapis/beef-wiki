_TODO_

## Feedback

* Apparently it has been blocked recently by Chrome : it is not working on my Chrome 22 with error : _Denying load of chrome-extension://bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp/manifest.json. Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension._ This has been corrected through whitelisting since Chrome 19 (see [here](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118693))
