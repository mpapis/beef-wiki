Extending the previously implemented Autorun capability within BeEF's Command Modules, the Autorun Rule Engine milestone aims to implement a method to automatically execute a set of modules based on previous module results. The process is data driven, and should be capable of running entirely within the hooked browser.

It is proposed that BeEF will come pre-canned with a number of templates to demonstrate the power of the Autorun Rules Engine. For example, a hooked browser could have a valid 'Internal_IP_Address' tag (set to say 192.168.1.5) and 'Browser' tag set to "Firefox", next the rules engine would fire all the modules that only require a valid 'Internal_IP_Address' as the input (such as the Internal Network Fingerprinting module), next, depending on the presence of a 'Internal_IP_Jboss_server', the rules engine would fire the JBoss JMX Upload exploit and so on.

To facilitate the Autorun Rules Engine it is suggested that the jools rule engine (https://github.com/tdegrunt/jools) be used. It is expected that from the Administrative interface the BeEF admin can enable or disable particular templates, and edit them using a clearly defined rules engine. To facilitate the potentially limitless field types that the Rules Engine requires (such as 'Internal_IP_Address', 'Internal_IP_Jboss_server', 'Squirrel_present' etc) the underlying database will need to be changed to support a tag-value system.
