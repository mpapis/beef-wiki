_A hooked web browser is actively polling the Communication Server_

### Introduction ###

An online hooked browser is a [[hooked browser|https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/Hooked-Browser]] which is polling the Communication Server. The polling is effectively how BeEF maintains a channel of communication.

If the browser stops polling the framework it becomes an [[Offline Hooked Browser|https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/Offline-Hooked-Browser]].
