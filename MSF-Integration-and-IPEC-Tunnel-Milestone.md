This milestone covers the outstanding MSF bugs and the MSF integration unit tests. It also includes wrapping MSF exploits in an IPEC tunnel. 

Currently, The MSF bridge lists all browser related exploits under one category in BeEF. Our target enhancements for this particular area include adding more intelligence to the exploit viewing and awareness to metadata such as OS target system, exploit options and exploit rating. This gives BeEF users the ability to quickly choose a good exploit that suites a specific target using the data that is already there in MSF exploits metadata and BeEF database.

Additionally, by adding IPEC tunneling, BeEF listens on a localhost port, tunnels anything it receives over http to the target's browser. With the browser hooked to BeEF, it translates the incoming IPEC traffic and directs to the target's Intranet.  Once this is working, BeEF could fire MSF exploits at the local port and have them hit a secure intranet target that maybe not even allowed to connect to the internet! Similar to how the proxy works, but in this case every byte coming in on the listening port is translated into JS byte array, passed to a hooked browser which reassembles them and then fires the data stream at the another target deeper into the network.
