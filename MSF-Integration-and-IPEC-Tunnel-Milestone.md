This milestone covers the outstanding MSF bugs and the MSF integration unit tests. It also includes wrapping MSF exploits in an IPEC tunnel. 

In IPEC tunneling BeEF listens on a localhost port and tunnels anything it receives over http and then at a target on the Intranet.  Once this is working BeEF could fire MSF exploits at the local port and have them hit the intranet target. Kinda like how the proxy works but in this case ever byte coming in on the listening port is translated in into JS byte array, passed to a hooked browser which reassembles them and then fires the data stream at the target.
