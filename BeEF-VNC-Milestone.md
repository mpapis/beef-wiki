Implement VNC style functionality in BeEF. 

This will allow real time monitoring of the hooked-browser’s view. That is, when the hooked browser follows a (onsite) link or enters content into input boxes it viewed/monitor/recorded in the framework. 

The framework will have a proxy running on the loopback. When a browser connects to this proxy the user can watch a playback or watch (and interact) real-time with the user’s session.
